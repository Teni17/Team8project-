Inventory Tracking System


Project summary:

A food bank inventory tracking system application for Acme Corp, tracking the kind, quantity, and expiration dates of donated goods.

This application has been requested by Acme Corp to fulfill various needs. Primarily, to track their food bank inventory as mentioned above. However, the application must also be able to pull data from multiple different entities that store inventory information. In order for Acme to create it's various reports, data from these entities must be compiled. The application will also possess a robust security system, including an accounts-based log-in system, two-factor authentication, and TLS encryption for deployment. These features combine to create the application in its entirety. The MERN tech stack will be used for development.

What's New (User Facing)

Project setup, we as a team have set up the project by following a tutorial on project setup. 
This will allow us to start production on our app, and we can start to implement features.

Work Summary (Developer Facing)

As a team we have worked through all of the assignments assigned in class, keeping us on track of our
development. To accomplish these assignments as a team we communicate through discord and divide the
work evenly to make it easier, fair and efficient. We then reconvene, to check for errors and other discrepancies
before we submit. Now we are on the part of starting development we are going to be accomplishing this
by working together as a team to identify features we want to add and dividing up the work.
